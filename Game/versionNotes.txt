Current Game Version
	[v.0.2.941]


 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			Side quest: Re-work to alpha.py | Done except for having my entities actually print to screen other than the walls.
			Plan to create a function in collision node to make setting up entity's collision clutter less of alpha.py.
			When alpha_v2.py is completely worked out it will replace the original alpha.py Once the mini rework is done I will return to collision
			to flush out the rest of its bugs. Future problems will hopefully have a simpler time to debug.

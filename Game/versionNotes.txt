 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			All that is left is to fix that stupid double bounce when colliding based on the directions. Most
			likely due to how I determine the directions. Once that is done the Collision re-work is mostly done.
			There is still setting it up for the other entities, and then to remember the main reason for the re-work.

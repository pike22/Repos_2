Current Game Version
	v.0.2.897


 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision:
			It has come to my attention that my method of collision is very inefficient and should be re-worked. The basic plan for that is to switch off
			of a graphics based system and more into the CPU side of things. This will prevent my game slowing down while testing the path finding. This re-work
			is for another time though and probably won't get done till after Breadth First Search works more smoothly.
 		PATH FINDING:
			Currently when the path moves right and down. The movement of my enemy is perfect to how I want him to move. Its to the left and up that is
			currently causing some different problems. The solution to my problem that I believe to work should be move my (x, y) coords on the enemy.
			This though has caused a series of problems. First being the enemy won't move but the path continues properly. The other thing is that when moveing
			left or up while using the top left corner of the enemy causes him to move in a direction early.

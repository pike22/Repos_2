 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			Cleaned up alpha.py in its v2. have now begun to rework the collision to work between player and walls. This is be the first step to re-creating
			the collision. Next will be to re-implement collision between entities and re-establish the weapons. The weapon Classes may need to be Cleaned
			up as well seeing as they hadn't had a touch up since the stone ages.

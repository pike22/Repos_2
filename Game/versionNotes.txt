Current Game Version
	v.0.2.93


 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			Base rework has been started. The use of a grid in collision is a massive simplification to Tkinters method of collision. I may no longer
			need to have a separate function for Side Calculation and the same goes for the Collision Node. Most of what I do could now be done in one
			function instead of two. Still in early stages of rework and nothing has been tested.

 		PATH FINDING:
			Works in all directions

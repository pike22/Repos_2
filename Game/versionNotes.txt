 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			Now with a consistent system than can identify objects that are colliding with one of the corners of
			my target object. Yesterdays problem was because when using an if statement to find if specific group-ID
			was in the roster. I used == instead of 'in' and that was the problem. Right now when the player temporally
			hits the wall and no more 'wasd' controls are used the player just continues to react to the wall even
			though it is no longer in contact with the wall. The player also bounces back and forth when continued
			collision with the wall happens. This should be an easy fix although the other problem takes priority.

Current Game Version
	v.0.2.91


 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision:
			It has come to my attention that my method of collision is very inefficient and should be re-worked. The basic plan for that is to switch off
			of a graphics based system and more into the CPU side of things. This will prevent my game slowing down while testing the path finding. This re-work
			is for another time though and probably won't get done till after Breadth First Search works more smoothly.
 		PATH FINDING:
			Works in all directions, now I need to reverse my collision so that it doesn't error out when I don't
			show the boxes in BFS. It turns out I was deleting from my path list to fast and it caused me to move one
			short. Some of the previous fixes I used actually hurt more than helped. The reason right and down
			didn't have any problems was because even though I deleted early when I hadn't moved out of Box0 was due
			to where tkinter originally drawls the coord point. Which caused a strange edge case for moving left and up.

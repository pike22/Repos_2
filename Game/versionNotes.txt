Current Game Version
	[v.0.2.935]


 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			Most of the base line has been completed, some of Collison Node has been reformed. I found it better to keep it separate to reduce clutter.
			I got stuck remaking the same logic for CL_v2 and reusing code from my graphics based collision. Where not I can just look at the 8 surrounding
			boxes to my target object and check for free spaces. Rather than using coordinates to find where objects are. This could change some of how CN_v2
			works as well. So I have plans to fix that and then implement this into my code and start testing my collision objects v2.

 		PATH FINDING:
			Works in all directions

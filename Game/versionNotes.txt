 ** Last Update Note:
 		Collision: Collision Re-work
			Slowly working my way back to collision, starting with stopping the player when I hit a wall. As of now
			I am working on having entities have four points of reference when finding what square they are in while
			walls only have one. As of now either both have four or both have one. When it should be player has four
			while walls have one. After that a hopefully quick implementation of figuring out the direction player
			came from and I should be able to actully re-create wall hit.

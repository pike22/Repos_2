 ** Last Update Note:
 		PATH FINDING:
			The search engine now will exit early if it finds its target. The self.__cameFrom dictionary is helping create a path, but sometimes the slime
			moves too far or too little and gets stuck on walls. Second, if the slime "reaches" its target a variable that gets passed has the Search Engine
			launch again. Every time this has overloaded Tkinter and has crashed. Tomorrow I plan to look more into moving too far/little and then continue to
			work on the 'reDrawl' as I call it.
